# MVC Pattern

Consists of:

- _Controller_ ( handles events, mediator btw view and model, _example:_ clicking button )
- _View_ ( cares about the DOM, _example:_ change the state of the screen )
- _Model_ ( cares about the data, _example:_ ajax )

## There cannot be mixed functional concers, be consistent
